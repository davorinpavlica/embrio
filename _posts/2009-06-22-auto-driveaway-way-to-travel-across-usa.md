In [my previous post](http://www.em3r10.com/blogi/davorin/usa-low-budget-cheap-trip/) I mentioned a way to travel across United States very cheap (drive somebody elses car for free) â€¦ and via Twitter (thanks @DeloMag) found the thing I was looking for. 

Itâ€™s called **Auto Driveaway** (check [AutoDriveAway.com](http://www.autodriveaway.com/)) and it can get you to one part of a country to another if youâ€™re not to picky about free car youâ€™d be driving , you can get it under these conditions:

* If you are at least 23 years of age or older with a valid driverâ€™s license (foreign travelers also need a passport with valid exit visa), you can travel the United States with Auto Driveaway.
* A refundable security deposit of approximately $350.00, check with the office that you are driving for to get the exact amount and method of payment on deposit.
* You will receive the first full tank of gasoline, a certain number of days and an appropriate amount of miles to complete your trip!
* A current MVR (motor vehicle driverâ€™s record) for ALL drivers will be needed when you arrive at the office to pick up the vehicle. If you do not have a MVR, one will be generated at a cost to the driver(s). Foreign travelers must bring a current Motor Vehicle Record from your home country.

On National Car List are quite a few cars available, so I checked all of them, and some are quite suitable for our little trip â€¦but they advise to call or e-mail each individual office for further information on the vehicles they have available (after the jump)!

## Free rides available on June 22, 2009

Images link to Google Maps, usually you get a full tank with the car, other gasoline is your own cost, so itâ€™s not a free ride after all ðŸ˜‰

* Fort Lauderdale, Florida â€“ Farmington, Connecticut
* Farmington, Connecticut â€“ Charlotte, N Carolina
* Long Beach, California â€“ Chincoteague Island
* Long Beach, California - Chincoteague Island
* Louisville, Kentucky â€“ Farmington, Connecticut
* New Orleans, Louisiana - Tonawanda, New York
* Phoenix, Arizona â€“ Bethesda, Maryland
* Portland, Oregon â€“ New Paltz, New York
* Salt Lake City, Utah â€“ Chicago, Illinois
* San Diego, California â€“ Meridian, Mississippi
* San Diego, California â€“ Panama City, Florida
* San Diego, California â€“ Park City, Utah
* Seattle, Washington â€“ Buffalo, New York
* Seattle, Washington â€“ Quincy, Massachusetts
* San Francisco, California â€“ Auburn Hills, Michigan
* San Francisco, California â€“ Brooklyn, New York
* Washington, DC â€“ Mobile, Alabama

So, you see â€¦ there are a lot of options for getting a free ride across USA (a few Coast to Coast rides as well), just pick one, drive and enyoj the adventure. For us the best choice is from San Francisco to New York, â€¦ but as you see you can find various routs to combine to get across United States of America.
